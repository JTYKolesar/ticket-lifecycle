<h3>&#9313; Assignment and Communication</h3>

_Tickets have been made! We'll now go into the Agent's perspective on their end:_
- On the web browser (Microsoft Edge), go to the Help Desk Login Page (http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php) and sign into the osTicket Help Desk credentials (this example uses username **ostuser / ostuser@email.com**).
